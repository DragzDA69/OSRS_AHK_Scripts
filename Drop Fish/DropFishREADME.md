## Drop Fish
### Drops your fish, so you dont have to!  

#### **NOTE:** This requires the assistance of the Runelite's [Left Click Dropper](https://github.com/JZomDev/zom-external-plugins/tree/065eca5a35bbc78f774ab9641d378aca1c2832ff) plugin - which can be found on the Plugin Hub.

Add <code>Leaping sturgeon</code>, <code>Leaping trout</code>, and <code>Leaping salmon</code> to the list as so <br/><br/>

## Item Skipping
Both scripts have the ability to be customized to avoid dropping a certain amount of items.  
This is primarily useful when obtaining items during fishing that you wish to keep - i.e. Clue Scrolls.

Any item(s) that you want to be skipped when dropping need to be stored in the _**4th slot of each row**_ - starting from the top.  
Example:

With _**Tool & Bait AHK**_ you can hold up to 5 items to keep from dropping,  
With _**Tool Only AHK**_ you can hold up to 6 items to keep from dropping.
